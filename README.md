I use a german Windows Keyboard Layout mapped to Mac

Until macOS Sierra I did this via Karabiner, but since Karabiner is broken in macOS Sierra, I have some workarounds.

## Remapping Left-Control and Right-Cmd with Karabiner Elements

We remap these two keys with [Karabiner Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) under macOS Sierra.
