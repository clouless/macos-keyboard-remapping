# macos-keyboard-remapping

I use a german Windows Keyboard Layout mapped to Mac.

Until macOS Sierra I did this via Karabiner, but since Karabiner is broken in macOS Sierra, I have some workarounds now.

## Remapping Left-Control and Right-Cmd with Karabiner Elements

We remap these two keys with [Karabiner Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) under macOS Sierra.

## Custom Keyboard Profile

I created a custom Keyboard Profile with [Ukulele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele)



I had to modify the XML further for:

  * Key `10` which has `>`, `<` and `|` mapped
